# Implementation Recommendations: Remove Unused Media Feature

**Plugin:** Media Wipe  
**Feature:** Remove Unused Media  
**Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Priority:** Medium-High  

## Executive Recommendation

**PROCEED WITH IMPLEMENTATION** using a conservative, phased approach. The feature is technically feasible and addresses a genuine user need, but requires careful implementation with clear limitations and robust safety measures.

## Key Recommendations

### 1. **Adopt Conservative Approach**
- **Start with high-accuracy detection only** (85%+ confidence)
- **Clearly communicate limitations** to users
- **Implement extensive safety measures** before any deletion
- **Provide detailed scan methodology** explanation

### 2. **Phased Implementation Strategy**

#### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Recommended for v1.2.0)
**Scope:** High-accuracy detection methods only
- Post content scanning
- Featured image detection
- Gallery attachment relationships
- Widget content scanning
- Basic customizer settings

**Benefits:**
- Lower complexity and risk
- Higher accuracy (90%+ expected)
- Faster development timeline
- Easier testing and validation

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Detection (v1.2.3)
**Scope:** Medium-accuracy methods with warnings
- Theme template file scanning
- CSS file parsing
- Advanced customizer settings
- Custom field scanning

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (v1.4.0)
**Scope:** Plugin integrations and automation
- Page builder support
- E-commerce integration
- Scheduled scanning
- Advanced reporting

### 3. **Critical Safety Requirements**

#### Mandatory Safety Features
1. **Backup Verification**: Require users to confirm backup creation
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Display confidence levels for each file
3. **Exclusion Lists**: Allow users to protect specific files
4. **Recent File Protection**: Exclude files uploaded within 30 days (configurable)
5. **Batch Testing**: Limit initial deletions to small batches
6. **Detailed Previews**: Show exactly what will be deleted

#### User Communication
```
⚠️ IMPORTANT ACCURACY NOTICE
This scan detects unused media with approximately 85-90% accuracy.
Some files marked as "unused" may actually be in use by:
- Theme templates or CSS files
- Plugins or custom code
- External websites or services

ALWAYS create a complete backup before deleting any files.
Start with a small test batch to verify accuracy.
```

### 4. **Technical Implementation Priorities**

#### High Priority (Must Have)
- **Robust error handling** for scan interruptions
- **Memory-efficient processing** for large libraries
- **Progress indicators** with cancel functionality
- **Result caching** to avoid repeated scans
- **Comprehensive logging** for troubleshooting

#### Medium Priority (Should Have)
- **Background processing** for large scans
- **Incremental scanning** for performance
- **Export/import** of scan results
- **Integration with existing DataTable** component

#### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- **Advanced filtering** and sorting options
- **Detailed usage reports** and analytics
- **API endpoints** for third-party integration
- **Automated scheduling** features

### 5. **Performance Targets**

#### Acceptable Performance Benchmarks
- **Small Libraries** (< 100 files): Complete scan in under 30 seconds
- **Medium Libraries** (100-1,000 files): Complete scan in under 5 minutes
- **Large Libraries** (1,000+ files): Complete scan in under 15 minutes
- **Memory Usage**: Stay under 256MB during scanning
- **Database Impact**: No more than 10% increase in query load

#### Optimization Strategies
1. **Chunked Processing**: Process files in batches of 50-100
2. **Smart Caching**: Cache results for 24 hours
3. **Selective Scanning**: Allow users to choose scan depth
4. **Background Jobs**: Use WordPress cron for large operations

### 6. **User Experience Guidelines**

#### Interface Design Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
2. **Clear Warnings**: Make limitations and risks obvious
3. **Confidence Indicators**: Use visual cues for accuracy levels
4. **Reversible Actions**: Provide undo options where possible
