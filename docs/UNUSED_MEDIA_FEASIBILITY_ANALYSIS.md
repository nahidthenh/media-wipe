# Remove Unused Media - Technical Feasibility Analysis

**Plugin:** Media Wipe  
**Feature:** Remove Unused Media  
**Analysis Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Analyst:** Technical Team  

## Executive Summary

The "Remove Unused Media" feature is **technically feasible** but comes with significant complexity and accuracy challenges. While WordPress provides mechanisms to detect media usage, achieving 100% accuracy requires comprehensive scanning across multiple contexts where media files can be referenced.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with implementation using a **conservative approach** with clear user warnings about potential limitations.

## Technical Feasibility Assessment

### ✅ **FEASIBLE ASPECTS**

#### 1. **Database-Level Detection (High Accuracy)**
- **Post Content Scanning**: Can reliably detect media in post_content via `wp_posts` table
- **Featured Images**: Easy detection via `_thumbnail_id` meta key
- **Gallery Attachments**: Detectable via `post_parent` relationship
- **Widget Content**: Scannable via `wp_options` table (widget data)
- **Menu Items**: Detectable in navigation menu structures

#### 2. **WordPress Core Integration**
- **Attachment Usage API**: WordPress provides `wp_get_attachment_url()` and related functions
- **Media Library Integration**: Can leverage existing media query functions
- **Metadata Access**: Full access to attachment metadata and relationships

#### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- **Batch Processing**: Can implement chunked scanning for large libraries
- **Caching**: Results can be cached to avoid repeated scans
- **Background Processing**: Can use WordPress cron for large operations

### ⚠️ **CHALLENGING ASPECTS**

#### 1. **Theme File Detection (Medium-Low Accuracy)**
- **Template Files**: Requires scanning PHP files for media references
- **CSS Files**: Must parse CSS for background images, font files
- **JavaScript Files**: Complex parsing for dynamic media loading
- **Hardcoded URLs**: Difficult to detect absolute URL references

#### 2. **Plugin-Generated Content (Low Accuracy)**
- **Dynamic Content**: Plugins may generate media references at runtime
- **Shortcodes**: Complex parsing required for shortcode-embedded media
- **Custom Fields**: Infinite variations in how plugins store media references
- **Third-party Integrations**: External services may reference media

#### 3. **Customizer and Theme Options (Medium Accuracy)**
- **Theme Customizer**: Can scan customizer settings in database
- **Theme Options**: Requires knowledge of each theme's option structure
- **Dynamic CSS**: Generated styles may reference media files

### 🚨 **HIGH-RISK SCENARIOS**

#### 1. **False Positives (Critical Risk)**
- **Hardcoded URLs**: Media referenced via direct URLs in content
- **External References**: Media used by external sites/services
- **Cached Content**: Media in cache that appears unused
- **Future Usage**: Media prepared for future content

#### 2. **Performance Impact**
- **Large Libraries**: Scanning 10,000+ media files could be slow
- **File System Access**: Checking actual file usage requires disk I/O
- **Database Queries**: Multiple complex queries needed for thorough scanning

#### 3. **Edge Cases**
- **Multisite Networks**: Complex media sharing scenarios
- **CDN Usage**: Media served from external CDNs
- **Import/Export**: Media relationships may break during migrations

## Accuracy Assessment by Context

| Context | Detection Accuracy | Implementation Difficulty | Risk Level |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Post Content | 95% | Low | Low |
| Featured Images | 99% | Very Low | Very Low |
| Gallery Attachments | 90% | Low | Low |
| Widget Content | 85% | Medium | Medium |
| Menu Items | 90% | Low | Low |
| Theme Templates | 60% | High | High |
| CSS Files | 70% | High | Medium |
| JavaScript Files | 40% | Very High | High |
| Plugin Content | 50% | Very High | Very High |
| Customizer Settings | 80% | Medium | Medium |
| Custom Fields | 70% | High | High |

**Overall Estimated Accuracy: 75-85%**

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. **Scanning Complexity**
```php
// Example of complex scanning requirements
function scan_media_usage($attachment_id) {
    $contexts = [
        'post_content' => scan_post_content($attachment_id),
        'featured_images' => scan_featured_images($attachment_id),
        'widgets' => scan_widget_content($attachment_id),
        'menus' => scan_menu_items($attachment_id),
        'customizer' => scan_customizer_settings($attachment_id),
        'theme_files' => scan_theme_files($attachment_id), // High complexity
        'plugin_content' => scan_plugin_content($attachment_id), // Very high complexity
    ];
    
    return array_filter($contexts);
}
```

### 2. **Performance Considerations**
- **Memory Usage**: Large media libraries require careful memory management
- **Execution Time**: May exceed PHP execution limits
- **Database Load**: Multiple complex queries impact performance
- **File System I/O**: Scanning theme/plugin files is resource-intensive

### 3. **User Experience Challenges**
- **Scan Duration**: Users may wait several minutes for results
- **Accuracy Warnings**: Must clearly communicate limitations
- **Preview Interface**: Complex UI needed for review and selection
- **Undo Functionality**: Critical for recovering from mistakes

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: **Conservative Core Implementation**
1. **High-Accuracy Contexts Only**
   - Post content scanning
   - Featured images
   - Gallery attachments
   - Widget content
   - Basic customizer settings

2. **Safety Features**
   - Clear accuracy warnings
   - Detailed preview before deletion
   - Backup recommendations
   - Exclude recently uploaded files

### Phase 2: **Enhanced Detection**
1. **Medium-Accuracy Contexts**
   - Theme template scanning
   - CSS file parsing
   - Menu item detection
   - Custom field scanning

2. **Advanced Features**
