== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin compatible with my WordPress version? =

Yes, Media Wipe is fully tested and compatible with WordPress 6.7.1 (the latest version) and works with WordPress 5.0 and above. It also supports PHP 7.4 to 8.3 and is multisite compatible.

= Is it safe to use this plugin? =

Yes, Media Wipe includes multiple safety layers including backup verification requirements, multi-step confirmation processes, and comprehensive audit logging. However, always create a complete backup before using any deletion features.

= Can I recover deleted files? =

No, once files are deleted using this plugin, they cannot be recovered. This is why the plugin requires explicit confirmation that you have created a backup before proceeding.

= What file types are supported for document preview? =

The plugin supports preview for PDF, Microsoft Office files (DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX), text files (TXT, CSV), and OpenDocument formats.

= Does this plugin delete files from the server? =

Yes, this plugin deletes both the database entries and the actual files from your server. All deletion operations are permanent and irreversible.

= How does the security audit system work? =

The plugin logs all activities including deletion attempts, security events, user information, IP addresses, and timestamps. You can view these logs in the Security Audit section of the admin menu.

= Can I configure the confirmation requirements? =

Yes, you can customize confirmation requirements in the Settings page, including backup confirmation requirements, text confirmation, and document preview settings.

= Is the plugin compatible with multisite installations? =

Currently, the plugin is designed for single-site installations. Multisite support is planned for future versions.

= How does rate limiting work? =

The plugin implements rate limiting to prevent abuse, allowing a maximum number of operations per hour. This helps maintain system stability and security.

= How accurate is the unused media detection? =

The AI-powered detection system is highly accurate, scanning posts, pages, widgets, menus, and theme files. Files with 90%+ confidence scores are very safe to delete. For maximum safety, always start with "Select High Confidence Only" and review lower-confidence files manually.

= Should I use Basic or Advanced scan? =

Basic scan is recommended for most users as it's faster and covers posts, pages, and widgets. Use Advanced scan if you have custom themes with hardcoded media references, but note it's slower and may have false positives due to theme file complexity.

= What does the confidence score mean? =

The confidence score (0-100%) indicates how certain the system is that a file is unused. 90-100% = very safe to delete, 75-89% = review recommended, 0-74% = manual review required. Higher scores mean safer deletions.
